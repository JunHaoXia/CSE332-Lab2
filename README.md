# CSE332-Lab2
Visualize the data you secured in project #1:

 use D3 as shown in class with either one plot at a time or
sequentially on a scroll-down webpage

Your visual interface should be able to (each 20 pts):

1. create a drop-down menu that allows users to select a variable
 
2. produce a bar chart (categorical variable) or histogram (numerical
 
variable) of the selected variable (make sure you make that distinction)

3. produce a pie chart of the selected variable (make sure you have no
more than 5-6 slices, sum the smaller ones into a single ‘others’ slice)

4. produce a scatterplot of two selected variables (use a radio button to
determine which of the two variable axes is to be loaded)

Deductions for:
 missing labels (axes, ranges, sectors, legends)
